Projinks == Project + Links
======== 

## Summary
Projinks is a chrome extension that allows you to keep collections of links that you'd use on projects, while testing, when browsing the internet, etc.  The intention is not to replace or rival bookmarking abilities of the browser or newer web apps that offer bookmark storage/sharing, but more to make you more productive using your links when it's necessary.

## Installation
Until Projinks is released in chrome store feel free to download this source code and install locally.

**STEPS:**

1. Download source 
2. [Follow the step here] (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

## Developer Notes
Hope you like the project.  All forks/pull request are welcome.  I will be publishing in the chrome store eventually.

Thanks, Darnell Lynch
