Projinks == Project + Links
======== 

## Summary
Projinks is a chrome extension that allows you to keep collections of links that you would use on projects, while testing, when browsing the internet, etc.  The intention is not to replace or rival bookmarking abilities of the browser or newer web apps that offer bookmark storage/sharing, but more to make you more productive using your links when it's necessary.
